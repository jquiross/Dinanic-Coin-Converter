# Dinanic-Coin-Converter
This project implements a dynamic currency converter that allows users to seamlessly convert between different currencies based on real-time exchange rates fetched from an API. The application utilizes modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Bootstrap for responsive design.

NOTE: If the software doesn't work, it may be due to reaching the maximum number of API requests or expiration of its functionality.
